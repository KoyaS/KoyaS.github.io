          For a project that I'm working on, I'd like to add a color gradient to
          align with the stylistic choices of the product. Upon implementation
          however, I'm having trouble writing a function to generate the
          Hexadecimal values for colors in the color gradient.

        <p>
          It's pretty widely known that computers use a combination of red,
          green and blue to show color on a screen. If you've ever heard RGB,
          this is what it refers to. A simple explanation as to why: these are
          the colors that the human eye can see. Though vastly oversimplifying,
          it's easiest to imagine that your eye has 3 different types of cells -
          cone cells - which are responsible for seeing red, green and blue
          respectively. All colors that we see are then combination of these
          base three and can be derived from different intensities of red, green
          and blue, respectively.
        </p>

          The human eye is where the RGB color system comes from. Monitors use
          this system to encode color into tiny red, blue and green LEDs. The
          format that we store this information for each pixel is
          <code>(R,G,B)</code> where each position is a number from 0-255
          representing at what intensity/brightness each color will be shown at.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it turns out,
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal#:~:text=Hexadecimal%20numerals%20are%20widely%20used,which%20is%20half%20a%20byte"
          >
            Hexadecimal is actually the same thing. </a
          >The format for Hexadecimal is <code>#RRGGBB</code> where the 0-255
          values are represented by numbers 0-9 and letters A-F which translate
          to be a range of <code>0-16</code> when combined. Hexadecimal is a
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp73wmn/revision/1"
            >base 16 number system </a
          >, as opposed to our standard base 10 system. Since
          <code>16*16=256</code> we can see how this is a direct translation,
          after making room for a 0.

          So, we have red, green and blue on linear scales from 0 to 255. What
          does this mean? This means that we can represent the colors in
          three-dimensional space. Don't worry, I'll draw it. But first, let's
          understand our axis. We have three, Red, Green, and Blue. The sides of
          our three dimensional space will look like this:
        </p>

        <span class="image fit"

        /></span>

        <p>
          Combining them into a full cube (connecting them at 0) this is what we
          get:

          This makes it a little bit easier to imagine the math that we're going
          to be doing to calculate a gradient. Imagine that inside this cube, we
          select two points, now physical locations in the cube, to calculate a
          gradient between. The literal representation of this gradient would be
          a straight line between the points.

          Let's start by choosing two random points, #264653 and #2A9D8F. Our

          A line between two points in 3D space is defined by:
